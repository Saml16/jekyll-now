    <td>I listened carefully to the Teacher's demonstration, I also used the internet for help when I got stuck on a part I was unsure of. I completed a lot on the work. I added a few more elements to my spreadsheet working towards the finished product. I am pleased with what 
I completed.</td>

    <td>Next time I will be more confident and ask the teacher for help, I will also try to not get so distracted so I can get more work done during the lesson. I can improve by using the time more effectively and trying different techniques.</td>

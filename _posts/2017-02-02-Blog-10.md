    <td>I listened to the teacher to help me and I also listened to other people's Ideas. I used the internet for most of my work. I learnt a lot from a lot of different websites.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>I took a long time for research and I wasted a lot of time trying to make my presentation look nice and adding fancy transitions instead of actually applying what I learnt into my presentation.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will look research other kinds of Ciphers instead of focusing on a main 3. This will give me a better understanding of a wider range of Ciphers. I will also ask more questions.</td>

    <td>My biggest help this week was Google. I used W3schools for the most part to help me with laying out my blog. I used a lot of the information and examples on the website and I am pleased with how much I learnt. I also took advice from the teacher to help.</td>

    <td>I listened to the examples the teachers gave me and I think it helped me out a lot. I think the only way I can improve though is if I have more confidence and ask the teachers for help next time when I get stuck.</td>
